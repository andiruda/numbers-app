<h1>Numbers App</h1>
<p>This is a very basic lighteight web applet that loads the last pwerball numbers in a specified date range and give statistics on the numbers.  There is a utilization of the "lucky number" system that uses a grading system for guessing which number might come up next!  This is just a silly implementation of some basic API and DB work in PHP.  The code needs to be offloaded into classes as it was just getting large enough to be organized.</p>
